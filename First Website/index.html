    <p>The debate as to whether video games are
        good or bad for us has been going since the 
        days of retro games such as <b>Pong</b> and <b>Space Invaders</b>.
    </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most people have always
        assumed that they were the cause of many mental
        and physical problems. Even there was a lack 
        of scientific evidence to prove it.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Some say it is in our human nature to find 
        something to blame when there is an issue, and
        video games have always been an easy target.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But these things have changed and now more
        professional studies are being conducted to
        find out the truth.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>Are video games good for you?</b></p>
    <br />
    <p>Or, do video games really hinder our ability to 
        learn, make us more violent, or affect our
        physical health?</p>
    <br />        
    <p>While there isn't enough evidence to offer a
        solid answer, the good news is that most
        researcher are discovering that games can be
        good for us.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This article will show you 10 reasons why video
        games are good for you.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Before you read further remember that anything in
        exceess can be harmful .</p>
    
    <br />
    <p>No benefit that comes from a video game will
        justify playing them for 10 hours a day.</p>
    <br />
    <p>It's ones responsibility to figure out how long
        you should play before putting the controller
        down and doing something else, as difficult as
        it may be</p>
    <br />
    <p>Video games are often blamed for being a bad
        influence and a big distraction for children
        and teens alike, but are they really all that
        horrible?</p>
    <br />
    <p>It all depends on how parents monitor the
        games that there kids are allowed to play
        and teaching them about the difference between 
        fiction and reality.</p>
    <br />
    <p>There are plenty of adults today that still play
        games. They claim that it keeps there mind fresh,
        helps them be more alert in real life, and keeps
        depression at bay. Here are 10 reasons why 
        video games deserve the benifit of the doubt.</p>
    <br />
    
    
    <h1><b>TEN REASONS WHY VIDEO GAMES ARE GOOD FOR YOU</b></h1>
    <br />
    <h1><a href="">1. Improves your vision</a></h1>
    <br />
    <img class="videogame" src="https://dankanator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/better-vision.jpg" alt="" height="380" width="550">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>First-person shooting games such as
        <b>"Call of Duty"</b> and <b>"Far Cry"</b> can actually improve
        your visual ability called <b>contrast sensitivity
        function</b>. This ability allows people to detect
        even subtle changes in shades of gray against a
        uniformly coloured backdrop, which is very
        important for reading and driving at night.
        However, contrast sensitivity decreases as you
        age. So exercising it with first-person on other
        action based games actually helps to prevent it
        from happening.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1><a href="">2. Could slow down aging</a></h1>
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Many of my relatives who's around his mid 50's is 
        still playing video games till this day. Science has
        shown that individuals from ages 50 and older 
        who play video games have an improved or
        stabilized mental state. Video games such as 
        <b>"World of Warcraft"</b> are complex and requires
        you to use your mental energy. It helps to exercise
        your brain which will be better for you
        in the long run.</p>

    <p>Studies have shoen that children and adults
        who are recovering from painful medical
        procedures felt less painn when thay were
        distracted bt video games. Playing video
        games helped to let their brain focus on other
        things instead of on their aching spots. It is also 
        proven that puzzle video games such as <b>"Angry Birds"</b>
        and <b>"Bejewelled"</b> can improves players' moods, 
        promote relacation, and ward off anxiety.</p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Strategy games that makes you scratch your
        head to solve its puzzeles can improve your
        solving skills. Real-time stategy games especially
        can help improve your overall cognitive flexibility
        in normal taskss. Video games can challenge your brain,
        but sometimes can frustrate you when you can't solve a level.
        Don't take the game too seriously, after all it's
        just a game.</p>

    <h1><a href="">5. Encourages physical activity</a></h1>
    <br />
    <img class="videogame" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2018/07/25115124/Kids-now-spend-twice-as-much-time-playing-indoors-than-outdoors-768x492.jpg" alt="" height="380" width="550">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Whether you're a fan of <b>"Fifa 2015"</b> or the 
        interactive games on the Nintendo Wii and Xbox
        Kinect, these somehoe can get you off the 
        couch to go and play the real thing. Studies have
        found that adolescents that play sports-themed
        video games will feel more intrested and encouraged 
        to try the sports in real life</p>
    <br />
    <p>What encourages them to try the sports in real-life 
        is the self-esteem and some sports knowledge gained from
        the sports themed games. The interavtive games on the 
        Nintendo, Wii, Playstation VR and Xbox Kinect can help you
        break a sweat while you are competing with someone at the
        same time.</p>

    <h1><a href="">6. Aids children with dyslexia to read better</a></h1>
    <br />
    <img class="videogame" src="https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02495/wii-dyslexia_2495740b.jpg" alt="" height="380" width="550">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Researchers have found that children with
        dyslexia who played action video games such as
        <b>"Rayman Raving</b>Rabids" and racing games such as
        "Forza Horizon" for 12 hours are able to
        read better then the ones who didn't play video 
        games. This is because action video games help
        to improve your attention skills making it
        easier for you to read faster and better</p>
    <br />
    <h1><a href="">7. Boosts your creativity</a></h1>
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Another health benifit that "Starcraft" can 
        provide to gamers is a more creative thinking.
        Fastpaced strategy games encourages players to 
        think about strategies faster and improve their
        multitasking abilitys. People who play video games 
        are more creative than people who play less because
        it increases your brain possibility to think deep 
        and open the doors of imagination of brain which 
        were closed before.</p>
    <br />
    <h1><a href="">8. Improves your social skills</a></h1>
    <br />
    <img class="videogame" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565870100382-f0a510db3cd1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1189&q=80" alt="" height="380" width="500">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Children who play more friendly or pro-social 
        games tend to have a happier outlook.
        Somehow they will be more sociable, helpful
        and less likely to behave badly in social 
        situations. Multiplayer games like <b>"Counter Strike Global 
        Offence(CS-GO)"</b>, <b>"Players Unknown Battleground(PUBG)"</b>,
        <b>"Defence of the Ancients(Dota)"</b> and <b>"League of Legends(LOL)"</b>
        somehow teaches player to work in teams, make decisions and
        build qualities such as leadership. That's why you have world 
        tournaments for these games because different people can
        work together with the aim to win the game.</p>
    <br />
    <h1><a href="">9. Helps control cravings</a></h1>
    <br />
    <img class="videogame" src="https://i0.wp.com/post.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Video_Game_Child_Room-1296x728-Header.jpg?w=1155&h=1528" alt="" height="380" width="550">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>What video games have is the power of 
        distraction. People who chose to play <b>"Tetris"</b>
        have less cravings while people who chose to
        wait for a computer program to load has a strong 
        craving. For example, if you're trying to stop smoking,
        we suggest you turn to video game before you succumb to
        your craving for a smoke somehow it will help a lot.</p>
    <br />
    <h1><a href="">10. Makes your hand-eye coordination better</a></h1>
    <br />
    <img class="videogame" src="https://www.cbc.ca/kidscbc2/content/the_feed//juggling_header.jpg" alt="" height="380" width="550">
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Gamers who have played games like <b>"Assassin's Creed"</b> and 
        <b>"Tomb Raider"</b> franchise might have a better hand-eye coordination
        than non-gamers.That's not to say that non-gamers can't be better
        but because gamers are trained when they play action games,
        they learn and perform faster. Also, surgeons who play video games
        made less mistakes and performed faster in laparoscopic surgery then
        those who didn't play games.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Video games definitely have some benefits if you know hoe to play
        it right. We are not encouraging everyone to play violent video games
        at it does have cons but it all falld down to how you control yourself.
        There are many action-packed video games that are not violent and wiil
        still give you exhilaration. It is after all fictional depictions of
        situation so none of what the games shows should be taken seriously.
        You should balance your video game time with your real life tasks too 
        because the reality is all there is and all there will be.
        So let the games be games.....!!!!!!!</p>
